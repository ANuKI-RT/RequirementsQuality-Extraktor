Telemetry Acquisition; List Sequence1It must be possible to know the times of telemetry acquisition. Therefore, if an internal timer is used it needs to be referenced/correlated to a known event or need to be synchronized to an external time reference. An example of an implementation is to use a Pulse Per Second event to reset an internal timer every second. The internal timer is then used to trigger telemetry acquisitions according to different telemetry acquisition lists at defined times within the one second period.2The triggering of each Telemetry acquisition list is only done by  one dedicated trigger event. However, there is nothing that prevents an implementation that allows different trigger events for a given Telemetry list as long as these are not active concurrently, i.e. a Telemetry acquisition cycle only uses one event type for that Telemetry list. There could be, concurrently, different trigger events for different lists.  The telemetry acquisition lists shall be triggered in the same sequence as defined by the sequence of the corresponding “Start Telemetry Acquisition” events.[END]
